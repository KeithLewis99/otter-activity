# The purpose of this file is import and examine otter activity data from Terra Nova National Park (TNNP) and the Glovertown Newfoundland area.  Data provided by David Cote, 2024-09-23, from Chelsey Lawrence's thesis.

# see notes from 2024-09-20 (notebook) for questions

# Set up a project - see the below link for directions.
#https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html

# But basically:
# 1.	Set up a Git repo on GitHub.
# 2.	Create the project in R - New Project - VErsion Control - Git
# 3. type "git add -A" in the terminal
# 4.	Create a bunch of directories automatically (see below)
# 5. Copy git -ignore file

#Create a "name_dat.R" file
#put this file in the folder with the project and create the following subfolders
if(!dir.exists("archive"))dir.create("archive")
if(!dir.exists("data"))dir.create("data")
if(!dir.exists("data_derived"))dir.create("data_derived")
if(!dir.exists("figs"))dir.create("figs") #for publication quality only
if(!dir.exists("output"))dir.create("output") # for tables and figures
if(!dir.exists("ms"))dir.create("ms") # manuscript
if(!dir.exists("report"))dir.create("report") #for rmd report
if(!dir.exists("refs"))dir.create("refs") #for rmd report

# Data ----

## camera activity data----
## 
df_act <- read_excel("data/camera_activity_5-11-2014.xlsx")
str(df_act)

# most of the data are date/time/site; the rest is temp and otters

unique(df_act$season) # not sure if this needs to be changed
# deployment_date and retrieval date are in a terrible format and don't quite match with date.  There is also a doy, day of study, month, timeofday (h:mm:ss) time.of.day (? PosicX??), hour, year, day.night.
# hours and days seem to be how long the camera was out

unique(df_act$year) # 2012, 2013, 2014

# site has a number and name
unique(df_act$site_name)
df_act$site_name <- as.factor(df_act$site_name)

summary(df_act)

unique(df_act$month)


df_act$month[df_act$month == "Feburary"] <- "February"

unique(df_act$month)
barplot(prop.table(table(df_act$month)))
# probably want to order this by Month so change with lubridate I think- 

# no records of doy or day of study from 11169 onwards 
plot(density(df_act$doy, na.rm = T))
df_act[is.na(df_act$doy), 10]

# temperature appears to be in F and C


# Otters are detected and number
plot(density(df_act$numberofOtter))


## latrine distributions ----
### See ReadMe for explanation - had to pivot from wide to long
### see Lawrence thesis, Table 2.1 for metadata
df_lat <- read_excel("data/latrine_distributions_29-7-2014.xlsx", sheet = "original")
df_lat <- df_lat[-9, ] # remove blank row

# change from wide to long format
df_latT <- setNames(as.data.frame(t(df_lat[-1])), df_lat[[1]]) |> tibble::rownames_to_column(var = "site.name")
head(df_latT)
str(df_latT)

# change data types
unique(df_latT$site.name)
unique(df_latT$latrine.present)
unique(df_latT$site.location)
plot(density(as.numeric(df_latT$droad)))


library(dplyr)
df_latT <- df_latT %>%
  mutate_at(c("droad", "dcabin", "treeheight", "dlogging", "dstreammouth", "dfreshwater", "dforagearea"), as.numeric) 

df_latT$site.location <- as.factor(df_latT$site.location)

df_latT <- df_latT |>
  mutate(lat.pres = if_else(latrine.present == "Y", 1, 0))
str(df_latT)
View(df_latT)

m1 <- glm(lat.pres ~ droad + site.location, 
          family = binomial(link = "logit"),
          data = df_latT)
summary(m1)


## camera functioning ----
### gives camera and dates deployed with number days out and days captured which I think is how many days of data.  NA means a "camera not set up" but in some cases, its blank.  Card filled seems to happen when days_capture << days_out.  But camera malfuction can also cause this problem - see Cote about this.
# "camera didnâ€™t trigger after" - not sure what this means?

# should filter out records based on camera malfunction and otehr criteria?
# do we need to extract date or is this in df_act?
df_cam <- read_excel("data/Camera_functioning.xlsx")
str(df_cam)
#View(df_cam)
unique(df_cam$year)
df_cam$days_out <- as.numeric(df_cam$days_out)
summary(df_cam$days_out)




# set up some binary data
Pres <- c(rep(1, 40), rep(0, 40))
rnor <- function(x) rnorm(1, mean = ifelse(x == 1, 12.5, 7.5), sd = 2)
ExpVar <- sapply(Pres, rnor)

# linear model with binary data...
lm(Pres ~ ExpVar)
