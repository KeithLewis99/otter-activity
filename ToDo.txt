# problem wiht outputs including DHARMA output: lots of warnings - I this is due to NA for lat/long and forage area and probably not a problem for now.  HOwever, it does mean that I can't do spatial autocorrelation yet.

think about what you want to do here.
Change UTMs to lat/long
Find AB sites

Diagnostics for log regression https://sscc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/RegDiag-R/logistic-regression.html#log_lin
	- need lat/long
	- spent most of the day on this - I think that its just best to use DHARMA but also need to check colinearity, outliers, and VIF
	- DHARMA seems the way to go.  A bit sad that there hasn't been much progress on this in 25 years.
	- dot plots - do for all data
	


fix doy in camera activity

get metadata

2024-11-28/29: sent an email to Cote requesting lat/long, forage area, and dlogging.

read thesis and see what was done - i'm sure I can do more and better 

make months into dates, not characters

fix variable types in latrine data as they are all character - make sure they don't change


Review: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/144121/logistic-regression-bernoulli-vs-binomial-response-variables
This is the difference between binomial and Bernoulli

Done:
get the variables in the right type for df_latT and then do a logistic regression
glm(y~ x, data = df_latT, dist = bernouli, link = logit)
create an analysis file for the logistic regressions
- see Zuur for EDA guide - implemented in quarto
get lat/long data that Cote sent
